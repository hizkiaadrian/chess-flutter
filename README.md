# Developer notes
The aim for this project is simply for me to learn Flutter, as well as a little bit of game development. Every time I have a desire to learn game development, I have been stunted by my lack of desire to do the graphics part (designing, etc.). If you're in the same situation, feel free to fork this repo and use my assets - I got them from Google anyway.

Lastly, if you'd like to collab and work on the future work, please don't hesitate to contact me at hizkiaadrians@gmail.com
